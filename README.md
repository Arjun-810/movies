# movies
I have to created a Movie streaming web app using the Django Framework. This app have two types of users, an admin (Manager) & some general users (multiple).

Once a general user is successfully logged in, he’ll be redirected to the All Movies page. All the movies available on the platform will appear
on this All Movies page in a grid format. Once the user selects a movie he’ll be redirected to the Movie Detail page. On the Movie Detail page,
the user can play the movie and post public comments. All the comments on the movie must be visible to all the users.
and in manager side when the manager successfully logged in. He will redirected to the manager dashboard page.  than
the admin has the right to add or delete movies from the All Movies page. The admin can also update the movie title or content
from the Movie Detail page. and the admin can edit movies. and delet comments from movies
